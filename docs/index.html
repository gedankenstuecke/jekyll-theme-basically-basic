introduction: |
    â€¦and I am a _well-behaved, medium-sized, mixed-breed dog_ (or at least that's what it says in my parents' rental agreement). 
    Originally I'm from RÃ©union ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡ª, but â€“ after a few years of living in Paris ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· â€“ I've now moved to the Royal Borough of Greenwich in London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.
