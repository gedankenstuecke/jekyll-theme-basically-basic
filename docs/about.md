        <h2>The early days…</h2>
        <p>
            No one really knows when, but I was born about <span id='years'></span>, on the island of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> 🇷🇪. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The French would say that I'm a <i><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bourbon_(chien)">Royal Bourbon</a></i>, but that's just a fancy way of saying that I'm a <i>mongrel</i> or <i>mutt</i> of the different breeds the French colonizers brought to Réunion.

        <p>
            I might style myself as a street dog (especially when eating garbage from the floor), but truth to be told: I was just a few weeks old when our whole litter was rescued by an association and flown to France 🇫🇷 to find some adoptive families for us there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on my amazing looks ✨ I was adopted straight away and got to enjoy the sun in the south of France 🌅. Unfortunately, I was a bit <i>too</i> needy for my first adoptive family…

        <h2>…to Paris 🧑‍🎨🥖…</h2>
        <p>
            …and that's how I ended up with Eugenia & Bastian, in the middle of Paris.
        </p>
        <p>
            Which was great food-wise – as there's plenty of perfectly good garbage everywhere on the floor – and I might have even made a doggie-friend or two. But it wasn't great in terms of parks, as for some reason they don't let dogs roam free in those!

        <h2>…to London! 🇬🇧💂</h2>
        <p>
            That's why I'm super happy that we're now living in London! In Greenwich I have 
            a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Park">lot</a>

            And not only parks, I also get to ride on busses and chase these animals I've never seen before in France: Squirrels 🐿️ and foxes 🦊!
