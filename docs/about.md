        <h2>The early daysâ€¦</h2>
        <p>
            No one really knows, but I was born about <span id='years'></span>, on the island of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9union">RÃ©union</a> ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡ª. 
            The French would say that I'm a <i><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bourbon_(chien)">Royal Bourbon</a></i>, but that's just a fancy way to say <i>mongrel</i> or <i>mutt</i>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I might love to style myself as a street dog (especially when eating garbage from the floor), but truth to be told: I was just a few weeks old when our whole litter was rescued by an association and flown to France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· to find some adoptive families for us there.
